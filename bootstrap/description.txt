These files should only exist in 'master'. They should never differ between BRANCHes. 

These go in your BUILD_HOME directory (by export/copy or wget) and they are simply to "get things started", 
such as via cronjobs, etc. Such as for Platform builds, in /shared/eclipse/builds. 

The bootstrap.sh fle is reponsible for getting all the other scripts that are required, 
from the right BRANCH, and starting a build for that BRANCH. 

They should not have to change often.

Versions in Maintenance branches removed, except for this readme, to avoid confusion.
