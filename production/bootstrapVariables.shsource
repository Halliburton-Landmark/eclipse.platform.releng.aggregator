# we set RAWDATE first thing, just to make it more accurate of "start of build"
# we have found on Hudson that by the time the build starts, it is often already 1 minute 
# past the time we requested. While this may eventually be fixed in Hudson (follow bug 496403), 
# in the meantime we will use a simple heuristic and deduct 30 from the RAWDATE we obtain, and then
# use that new value through out. We first deducted 60 (bug 496345), but that was too much (bug 500233).
