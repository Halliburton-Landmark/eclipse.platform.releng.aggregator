	/**
	 * Verify two sets of features and return a status object indicating whether or not the version numbers
	 * of the features (an optionally of their included plug-ins) have been incremented appropriated based
	 * on the changes between the two sets.
	 * <p>
	 * Feature Version update priority:
	 * Versions have four parts: major, minor, micro, and qualifier. 
	 * There are four corresponding kinds of version update: major update, 
	 * minor update, micro update, qualifier update. Besides, there are two 
	 * other kinds of update: new_added update(if some features or plugins 
	 * have been new added to the feature), and no_longer_exist update(if 
	 * some features or plugins have been deleted from the feature). Consequently, 
	 * major update has the highest priority, then minor update (currently 
	 * new_added and no_longer_exist are considered as minor updates), then 
	 * micro update, and qualifier update has the lowest priority. If we talk
	 * about version update of a feature or a plugin, we mean the update with 
	 * the highest priority.
	 * </p><p>
	 * Feature Version update rule: 
	 * Usually, a feature includes other features and plug-ins, 
	 * e.g. : 
	 *  old version of "f1":
	 * <pre>
	 * 	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	 * 		<feature id="f1" label="aaa" version="1.0.0.v2005">
	 * 			<includes id="f2" version="1.0.0.v2005" name="bbb"/>
	 *          <includes id="f3" version="1.0.0.v2005" name="ccc"/>
	 *          <plugin id="p1" version="1.0.0.v2005"/>
	 *          <plugin id="p2" version="1.0.0.v2005"/>
	 *          <plugin id="p3" version="1.0.0.v2005"/>
	 *      </feature>
	 * </pre>
	 *  new version of "f1":
	 *  <pre>
	 * 	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	 * 		<feature id="f1" label="aaa" version="3.0.0">
	 *  		<includes id="f2" version="2.0.0.v2005" name="bbb"/>
	 *          <includes id="f3" version="1.1.0.v2005" name="ccc"/>
	 *          <plugin id="p1" version="1.0.1.v2005"/>
	 *          <plugin id="p2" version="1.0.0.v2006"/>
	 *          <plugin id="p4" version="1.0.0.v2006"/>
	 *      </feature>
	 * </pre></p><p>
	 * The basic rule of version update is that if we have updated versions of 
	 * any include features(f2,f3) or plugins(p1,p2), we need to update the version 
	 * of f1. Update of f1 should be at least the highest update of its included 
	 * features and plug-ins. For instance, "f2" has a major update, "f3" has a minor 
	 * update, "p1" has a micro update, and "p2" has a qualifier update, "p3" no 
	 * longer exists in "f1", "p4" has been new added to "f1". In conclusion, "f1" 
	 * should at least have a major change(it's ok if "f1" also has a minor, micro,
	 * or qualifier update). 
	 * </p><p>
	 * Feature Verification process:
	 * To verify the new version of "f1", we need to compare its included features 
	 * and plug-ins with those included in its old version and find out the update
	 * with the highest priority. For included features, such as "f2" and "f3", before
	 * comparing them with their corresponding ones in old "f1", we need to verify
	 * their new versions first through recursion, and then,
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>if the new versions of "f2" is correct, we use the new version of "f2" to 
	 * compare with the version of "f2" in old "f1".
	 * <li>if the new versions of "f2" is wrong, we try to generate a recommended new
	 * version for "f2", and then,
	 *<li>if we can generate a recommended new version for "f2", we use the recommended
	 * new version to compare with the version of "f2" in old "f1".
	 * <li>if we can not generate a recommended new version for "f2", there must be
	 * some error occurred. We will create a warning message for that error and
	 * we will also create a message to tell user that "f1" can not be verified 
	 * correctly, since we can't verify some of its included features. (The process
	 * will not stop if we find an error. It will continually to compare and try 
	 * to find problems as more as possible, and warning messages will be collected,
	 * and displayed at last.)
	 * </ul>
	 * </p><p>
	 * We must increment the major part if:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>an included feature has incremented the major part of its version
	 * <li>an included plug-in has incremented the major part of its version
	 * </ul>
	 * </p><p>
	 * We must increment the minor part if:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>an included feature has incremented the minor part of its version
	 * <li>an included plug-in has incremented the minor part of its version
	 * <li>if a new plug-in was added to the feature
	 * <li>if a plug-in was removed from the feature
	 * <li>if a new included feature was added to the feature
	 * <li>if an included feature was removed from the feature
	 * </ul>
	 * </p><p>
	 * We must increment the micro part if:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>an included feature has incremented the micro part of its version
	 * <li>an included plug-in has incremented the micro part of its version
	 * </ul>
	 * </p><p>
	 * We must increment the qualifier if:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>an included feature has incremented the qualifier part of its version
	 * <li>an included plug-in has incremented the qualifier part of its version
